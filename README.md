# project_euler_es6

This repository is a fun repository for solving [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/) riddles with es6.
It has two main purposes:
* Solve the riddles with advanced es6 syntax
* Solve cool riddles anyway

## Contributions

The following contributions are welcome:

* Better syntax for solving issues
* Better algorithms for existing solutions

I would prefer not to get new solutions as I want to solve them alone :-)
